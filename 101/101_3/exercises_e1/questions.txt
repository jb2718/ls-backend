Q1. 
I would expect the code to print out the original array.  The reason being that the method uniq did not mutate the original numbers array.


Q2.
'!' is usually an indicator that the method will mutate its caller.  It can also mean NOT.

 '?' usually indicates that the method will return a boolean value

- 1) != means 'not equal to'; it should be used in boolean equations

- 2) !user_name would return the opposite of user_name's truth/false value.  If it user_name evaluates to true, then !user_name would be false and vice versa.

- 3) In this scenario, the ! means the method uniq! will mutate the content of the variable words 

- 4) '?' before something can be part of the ternary operator --> condition ? choice for true : choice for false

- 5) Putting '?' after a method is usually an indicator that the method will return true/false

- 6) Putting '!!' before something will return the boolean value the something would have returned to begin with...it is like a double negation


Q3. See program q3.rb

Q4.
numbers.delete_at(1) will delete the value at index 1 of the numbers array

number.delete(1) will delete all values of '1' in the array
