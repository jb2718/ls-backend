# A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# -------------
# Casual
# -------------
# Given an array of integers
# Create an empty array called every_other
# Iterate through the array of integers
# - if the iterator is even, add the current value to every_other
# - otherwise, go to the next loop cycle

# After iterating through the array of integers, print every_other

# -------------
# Formal
# -------------
# START
# Given an array of integers: arr
# SET every_other = []
# SET iterator = 0
# WHILE iterator < length of arr
  # - IF iterator is even
  #   SET every_other << current value
  # - ELSE
  #   Go to next loop cycle (do nothing)
# PRINT every_other
# END
